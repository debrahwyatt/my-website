      My public repository of projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/debrahwyatt" target="_blank">https://github.com/debrahwyatt</a>, but here are a few of my more notable projects: <br/>

      <br/>
      <a href="https://github.com/uvicaiclub/ai-club-website" target="_blank"><b>UVic AI Website and Chatbot:</b></a> <br/>
      The original UVic AI Club website equiped with a nifty little chatbot inspired by the Russian chatbot P-bot.<br/>
      <br/>
      <a href="https://github.com/debrahwyatt/TrafficApp.py" target="_blank"><b>Traffic Tracker:</b></a> <br/>
      This program allowed the user to guage the travel time between two points using Google maps data, and determine the best time to travel. It was discontinued after Google started charging for API usage.<br/>
      <br/>
      <a href="https://github.com/debrahwyatt/dubby" target="_blank"><b>Battlesnake:</b></a> <br/>
      The name of the snake was Dubby, and he was entered into the 2020 Battlesnake tournament. This snake used traditional heuristics and pathfinding to place top 8 in the beginners bracket.<br/>

      This program sorted my grovery list based on aisles, which I would then text to my wife to make her grocery trips easier.<br/>
